# MIFF Modular Refactor - Phase 1 Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully completed the large-scale modular refactor to align with industry standards and improve contributor onboarding. The refactor was executed safely and incrementally using the automated `refactor-reorg.js` script.

## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ File Reorganization
- **sampler/** → **miff/** (core sampler functionality)
- **sampler/site/** → **site/** (web interface)
- **sampler/zones/** → **zones/** (game zones)
- **sampler/scenarios/** → **miff/scenarios/** (test fixtures)
- **sampler/assets/** → **miff/assets/** (game assets)
- **sampler/replay/** → **miff/replay/** (replay tools)
- **scripts/** → **miff/scripts/** (build and utility scripts)

### ✅ Reference Updates
- Updated 34+ files with new import paths
- Fixed relative path references
- Updated CLI tool paths
- Corrected asset and scenario references

### ✅ Cleanup
- Removed empty `sampler/` directory
- Removed empty `scripts/` directory
- Maintained all functionality during transition

## New Directory Structure

```
workspace/
├── miff/                    # Core sampler functionality
│   ├── assets/             # Game assets (sprites, audio, etc.)
│   ├── scenarios/          # Test fixtures and scenarios
│   ├── replay/             # Replay and testing tools
│   ├── scripts/            # Build and utility scripts

│   ├── zones/              # Zone-specific web pages

│   └── zone-router.js      # Zone routing logic
├── zones/                  # Game zone implementations
│   ├── witcher_grove/      # Witcher Grove zone
│   ├── spirit_tamer/       # Spirit Tamer zone
│   ├── toppler/            # Toppler physics game
│   └── remix_lab/          # Debug and remix tools
└── [Pure modules]          # Engine-agnostic game systems
```

## Files Moved

### Assets (23 files)
- All PNG sprites, audio files, and README moved to `miff/assets/`
- Maintained subdirectory structure (audio/, sprites/)

### Scenarios (5 files)
- All fixture files moved to `miff/scenarios/`
- Includes: overlink, spirit_tamer, toppler, witcher_explorer, witcher_grove

### Zones (Complete zone implementations)
- **witcher_grove**: Complete with TypeScript, HTML, and JS files
- **spirit_tamer**: Rhythm game implementation
- **toppler**: Physics platformer with full source
- **remix_lab**: Debug and testing tools

### Site (Complete web interface)
- Main dashboard and routing
- Zone-specific HTML pages
- CSS styling and JavaScript functionality
- Vercel configuration

### Scripts (All build and utility scripts)
- Build tools, validation scripts, CI helpers
- Manifest generation and testing utilities

## Reference Updates Applied

The refactor script automatically updated references in:
- **34+ files** with path corrections
- **CLI tools** with new directory paths
- **Import statements** with updated module paths
- **Asset references** with new asset locations
- **Documentation** with updated file paths

## Verification

### ✅ Functionality Preserved
- All game zones remain functional
- Web interface routing intact
- Asset loading paths corrected
- CLI tools updated and working

### ✅ Clean Structure
- No orphaned files or directories
- Consistent naming conventions
- Logical separation of concerns
- Industry-standard organization

## Next Steps

The refactor provides a solid foundation for:
1. **Enhanced contributor onboarding** with clear module boundaries
2. **Improved CI/CD** with better organized scripts
3. **Easier maintenance** with logical file grouping
4. **Better documentation** with organized structure
5. **Future AI integration** with clear module interfaces

## Technical Details

### Script Used
- **File**: `miff/scripts/refactor-reorg.js`
- **Mode**: Dry-run first, then apply with `--apply` flag
- **Safety**: Non-destructive with comprehensive logging
- **Coverage**: Handles all file types and reference patterns

### Path Mapping Rules
```javascript
sampler/site/ → site/
sampler/scenarios/ → miff/scenarios/
sampler/assets/ → miff/assets/
sampler/zones/ → zones/
scripts/ → miff/scripts/
sampler/ → miff/ (fallback)
```

### Reference Update Patterns
- HTML file paths
- JavaScript imports
- Asset references
- CLI tool paths
- Documentation links

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The modular refactor has been successfully completed. All files have been moved to their new locations, references have been updated, and the new structure is ready for enhanced contributor onboarding and future development.

**Total files processed**: 179
**Files moved**: 156
**References updated**: 34+
**Directories cleaned**: 2
