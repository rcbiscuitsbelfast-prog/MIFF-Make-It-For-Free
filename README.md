MIFF: Make It For Free

Modular, CLI‑First Game Framework (Unity Runtime)

Started with a Retro-style 2D RPG engine and became a set of engine-agnostic, CLI-first gameplay modules for rapid iteration.

## Requirements

- Unity 2021.1 or greater (for runtime)
- Node.js 18+ (for CLI harnesses)

## CLI-First Modules

Each module comes with a self-contained CLI harness under the repository root. Run with ts-node:
