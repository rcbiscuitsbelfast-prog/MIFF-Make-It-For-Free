# MIFF Discussion: Phase 17 â€” CI + Test Recovery, Spirit Tamer Ready

We just landed core CI and Jest environment fixes for MIFF. This unblocks multi-agent playtesting and contributor onboarding.

## Highlights
- Added main CI workflow (Node 18, typecheck, tests)
- Split Jest into DOM and Node projects (fixing canvas/DOM tests)
- Spirit Tamer: Trial of the Grove orchestration verified; start_grove export added
- New helper scripts: fix-test-paths, validate-bridge

## Call for Contributors
- Try the Color Clicker Onboarding Challenge
- Add a new modular zone (remix-safe assets only)
- Improve failing test suites (EventBus, Network, Inventory, Dialogue, Modding)
