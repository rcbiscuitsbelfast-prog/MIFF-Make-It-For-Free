## Phase 5: Playing Community Worlds

### 5.1 Remix Launch System

**Validation Pipeline:**
```typescript
async function launchCommunityRemix(manifest: RemixManifest): Promise<boolean> {
  // 1. Validate manifest integrity
  const validManifest = await validateManifest(manifest);
  
  // 2. Check asset availability
  const assetsAvailable = await verifyAssets(manifest.assets);
  
  // 3. Apply safety checks
  const safetyCheck = await performSafetyValidation(manifest);
  
  // 4. Load base scenario
  const baseScenario = await loadScenario(manifest.baseScenario);
  
  // 5. Apply remix changes
  const modifiedScenario = applyChanges(baseScenario, manifest.changes);
  
  // 6. Launch game
  return startGame(modifiedScenario);
}
```

**Error Handling:**
- Missing assets fallback system
- Corrupted data recovery
- Version compatibility checks
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features

CREATE TABLE remixes (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    author_id UUID,
    base_scenario VARCHAR(100),
    manifest_data JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    upvotes INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
