# Dev Notes

## Solutions to solved problems
- TransparentFX layer has to be disabled in Camera's culling mask, to not render the elements on it
- For the OnTriggerStay2D event to work properly, the Rigid2DBody Sleep Mode has to be on "Never Sleep", otherwise this is only triggered once
- The Static flag in the inspector is useful, when enabled, for elements that never move. Optimizes the game, so less calculations are made.
-

## ToDos
- Refactor Movement system (using editor-assigned properties, events like onMoveEnd, move disable/enable, better decoupling,...)
	- MoveTo does not work with warp post movement
	- We need a way to disable step-movement when teleporting, enabling it again for the postWarpMove
	- We need a way to reactivate warping and collisions when movement is finished
- Refactor Warping system after movement one, if needed
- add debug GUI and enable it via the PlayerHouse PC. add steps counter and show it, together with FPS


## Issues
- Maybe warpCoords make moveSteps to not work in WarpController
- Sometimes text dialogs are not in the right order, they get mixed and lost
- Triggering a dialog may not respond to buttons
- When fading on warp player can still move

## GameData Schema and Migration
- Schema version bumped to 3 to include `quests` list for QuestState.
- Migration: `SaveManager.Load()` initializes `quests` if missing and logs migration.
- Schema version bumped to 4 to include `inventory` list for items.
- Migration: `SaveManager.Load()` initializes `inventory` if missing and logs migration.
- Schema version bumped to 5 to include `dialogs` store for branching dialog.
- Migration: `SaveManager.Load()` initializes `dialogs` if missing and logs migration.
- Schema version bumped to 6 to include `creatures` and `party`.
- Migration: `SaveManager.Load()` initializes `creatures` and `party` if missing and logs migration.
- Schema version bumped to 7 to include `codex` and optional `loreEntries` preload.
- Migration: `SaveManager.Load()` initializes `codex.unlocked` if missing and logs migration.
- Schema version bumped to 8 to include `settings` (musicVolume, sfxVolume, language, showSubtitles).
- Migration: `SaveManager.Load()` initializes `settings` if missing and logs migration.
- Schema version bumped to 9 (doc sync); see ROADMAP for details.
- Schema version bumped to 10 to include XP/Leveling (`xp`, `levels`).
- Migration: `SaveManager.Load()` initializes `xp` and `levels` if missing.
 - Schema version bumped to 11 to include `saves` map and `currentSlot` for SaveLoadPure.
 - Migration: Legacy v10 data is wrapped into `saves["migrated-xp"]` as a v11 snapshot by SaveLoadPure.

## XPLevelingPure
- Managers: `XPManager` (runtime XP/level) and `LevelUpManager` (curve loader)
- Data: `Assets/Resources/levels/level_curve.json`
- CLI: npx ts-node --compiler-options '{"module":"commonjs"}' XPLevelingPure/cliHarness.ts XPLevelingPure/sample_commands.json

## Species and Creatures JSON
- Species JSON (`Resources/species/species.json`):
```
{
  "species": [
    {"id":"sprout","nameId":"species.sprout","baseHp":35,"baseAttack":10,"baseDefense":8,"baseSpeed":12,"captureRate":60,"allowedMoves":["tackle","grow"]}
  ]
}
```
- Creatures are generated at runtime by `CreatureFactory` and persisted in `GameData.creatures` as entries containing ids, stats, and moves.

## Scene Setup: QuestManager Lifecycle
- `QuestManager` is auto-instantiated by `GameManager.Awake()` if missing, and marked `DontDestroyOnLoad`.
- For explicit scene setup, you may add a `QuestManager` GameObject to `Main.unity`.

## Scene Setup: InventoryManager Lifecycle
- `InventoryManager` is auto-instantiated by `GameManager.Awake()` if missing, and marked `DontDestroyOnLoad`.
- `InventoryUI` stub logs Open/Close and can be wired to a menu later.

## Audio Mixer Integration
- `AudioMixerManager` maps linear [0..1] volumes to decibels via 20*log10(linear) with a floor at -80 dB.
- Ensure Unity AudioMixer exposes parameters `MusicVolume` and `SFXVolume` and is loadable via Resources if not assigned.
